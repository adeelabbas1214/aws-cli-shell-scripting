## Script Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Prompts the user for the S3 bucket name and region.
2. Creates the S3 bucket with the specified parameters.
3. Optionally sets a public read access policy for the bucket.

# Notes
AWS CLI Configuration: Ensure that your AWS CLI is configured with access keys that have permissions to create S3 buckets.

Bucket Name: The bucket name must be globally unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3. You may encounter an error if the name is already in use.

Region: If you donâ€™t provide a region, it defaults to us-east-1. You can specify a different region as needed.

Public Access: The script provides an option to set public read access. Modify the bucket policy as needed for your requirements. Be cautious when granting public access to ensure sensitive data is not exposed.

Error Handling: The script checks for successful bucket creation and exits if it fails, providing feedback on the operation's success.
